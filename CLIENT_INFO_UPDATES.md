## üîß Technical Implementation

### Centralized Configuration
The site uses a centralized configuration file (`config/site.config.ts`) that makes it easy to update contact information in one place. All components pull from this config file.

### Form Submission Flow:
1. User fills out form
2. Form validates required fields (HTML5 validation)
3. On submit, form sends POST request to API route
4. API route validates data server-side
5. API route logs submission (ready for email integration)
6. Success/error response sent back to client
7. User sees appropriate message
8. Form clears on success

### Error Handling:
- Network errors caught and displayed
- Server errors handled gracefully
- User always gets feedback
- Fallback: Call directly at (412) 819-8772

---

## üìß Next Steps: Email Integration

The forms are fully functional but currently log submissions to the console. To receive email notifications:

### Recommended: SendGrid
```bash
npm install @sendgrid/mail
```

Add to `.env.local`:
```
SENDGRID_API_KEY=your_api_key_here
```

Update API route to send emails to: **nyeroelectric@gmail.com**

### Alternative Options:
- **Resend**: Modern email API
- **Nodemailer**: SMTP-based (works with Gmail)
- **AWS SES**: If using AWS infrastructure
